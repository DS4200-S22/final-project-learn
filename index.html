      <h1>Abstract</h1>

      <p>
        Jobs in technology are appearing faster than any other fields and paying
        much more. Yet, unequal access to computer science education in
        Massachusetts public high schools remains an issue. Despite access to
        national educational datasets and school-by-school course offerings,
        determining which schools teach computer science and the demographics of
        students taking these courses is arduous without proper tools. We
        propose a visualization tool, LEARN, for educators and members of
        Northeastern University’s club, FirstByte, who hope to identify public
        schools in Massachusetts that do not teach computer science or do not
        provide equal access to computer science education. Our approach would
        allow users to easily view and understand the levels of accessibility to
        Computer Science courses in different public schools. Insights derived
        from our visualization are aimed at determining which schools need the
        most support to start teaching computer science.

      <h1>Visualization Explanation</h1>

      <p>
        LEARN’s intended use is to allow individuals to easily determine which schools in Massachusetts
        do/do not offer computer science education, to identify underrepresented communities in the
        Massachusetts schools, and to be able to compare a school's demographics to other schools in their
        county. To use the visualization, a user can highlight over different points on the left point map. Each point
        links to the corresponding county on the right map by highlighting it in blue. Additionally, each point has a tooltip
        on hover that shows the school's name, county, if it offers CS education, and what type of school it is. On the second
        tab, the user can look at the data on a table by highlighting each row and can filter with a search bar by school name.
