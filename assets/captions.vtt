00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.910
LEARN: Visualizing Unequal Access to Computer
Science education in Massachusetts as part

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.420
of Ab Mosca’s information presentation and
visualization course at northeastern university.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.950
The purpose of our tool is to provide Northeastern
University’s club FirstByte, who distributes

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.550
computer science education materials across
Massachusetts schools, with accurate data

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.990
and information about potential schools to
send resources to.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.449
Our tool can also be utilized by other grade-level
education focused clubs and organizations,

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.439
and people who are curious about information
on Massachusetts schools.

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.300
I will now be waling you though out visualization
tool.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.520
There are 2 tabs, a map view and a table view,
we will start with the map view.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.710
On the left, there is a map with a dot for
each school in our database.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.040
Each blue dot represents a school that has
CS education and each red dot represents a

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.560
school that does not have CS education.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.760
Watch as a I hover over this blue dot.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.060
We can now see the school’s name, the county
that it is located in, if it has CS education

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.600
or not, and the type of school that it is.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.140
The map on the right will highlight the county
the school is located in while we are hovering

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.220
over any point on the left map.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.219
If we hover over the right map only, a tool
tip will appear under each county

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.950
we are highlighting with the county's name.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.829
Now onto the table view functionality, we
offer the functionality

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:25.299
for the user to search for a school and its

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.350
information based on its name

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.350
So for example.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.170
Ill start typing is 'Boston' as you
can see here all the schools that are in Boston

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.630
will appear.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:43.770
and if we get more specific, fewer schools
will appear, then

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.330
the one school we are searching for will appear
here.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.119
Then we can see if it offer's CS, the number
of students it has

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.319
the school district name, and the county.

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.310
All in all, our visualization tool supports
the ability to have an overview of which schools

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.850
in Mass have CS education and which counties
they are located in, and then get more detailed

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.359
information about any school in the map through
searching.

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:04.059
Thank you!
